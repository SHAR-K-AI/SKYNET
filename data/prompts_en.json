    "text": "First ask me to upload an image and then create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the characters in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment. The figurine is placed on a computer desk. The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is a 3D modeling process of this figurine. Next to the computer screen is a toy packaging box, designed in a style reminiscent of high-quality collectible figures, printed with original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations."

Capture the scene with a natural photographic look, realistic lighting, skin texture, and detail. The framing, angle, and perspective should be as realistic as possible, as if it were an actual photo."

    "text": "First ask me for a selfie. Transform my selfie into a fresh but professional image suitable for a social media profile. The lighting should be natural, flattering, and multidimensional. My head is slightly tilted so it doesn't look stiff and it should look like I'm in a modern, bright office with a blurred background."
