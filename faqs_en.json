    "answer": "Preemptible VMs in Google Cloud are short-lived, cost-effective virtual machines designed for workloads that can tolerate interruptions. These VMs are offered at a significantly lower price compared to regular VMs, but they can be terminated by Google at any time if the cloud infrastructure needs to reclaim the resources. Preemptible VMs are ideal for batch processing, big data jobs, and fault-tolerant workloads that can be easily restarted. Each instance has a maximum lifetime of 24 hours, and users are given a short warning before the VM is preempted. By leveraging Preemptible VMs, organizations can significantly reduce their computing costs while handling tasks that can withstand occasional interruptions. They integrate seamlessly with Google Compute Engine and support auto-scaling and containerized workloads, making them an attractive option for cost-conscious projects."
